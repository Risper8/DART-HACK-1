# DART-HACKATHON

**Hello Friend, Welcome to my Dart Hackathon Repository**

This repository contains a collection of Dart programs designed to provide educational value and interactive experiences for users. The programs cover various aspects, including user input handling, mathematical operations, grading systems, a math quiz adventure game, and a student support program.

## Challenge 1
Below are the tasks given for this dart challenge:

* Program 1: Display Personal Information
  
  Write a Dart program using variables to display your name, age, school, and a hobby. Print it in one logical sentence.

* Program 2: Perform Mathematical Operations with Functions
  
  Write a Dart program that performs two mathematical operations using functions.

* Program 3: Determine Grade Based on Marks
  
  Write a Dart program to determine the grade based on a student's marks. The program should print out the appropriate grade according to the following criteria:

  If the marks are greater than 85, print "Excellent".

  If the marks are between 75 and 85 (inclusive), print "Very Good".

  If the marks are between 65 and 75 (inclusive), print "Good".

  If the marks are below 65, print "Average".

### To add an intriguing twist to the learning experience, I've crafted engaging programs like the Math Quiz Adventure and Student Support program.

**Programs Included:**

1. *User Input Handling:*
Description: This program allows users to input data such as their name, age, school, and hobbies, providing a personalized experience.

2. *Mathematical Operations:*
Description: Users can perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced operations (square, square root, power) with this program.

3. *Grading System:*
Description: The grading system program evaluates students' scores based on CAT 1, CAT 2, and final exam results, providing an average score and a corresponding grade.

4. *Maths Quiz Adventure:*
This engaging game is tailored for kindergarten kids to practice and reinforce their understanding of fundamental mathematical operations. It offers a delightful journey through seven levels, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, and power. As children progress through each level, they'll encounter interactive math questions designed to stimulate learning and foster confidence in their math skills.

6. *Student Support program:*
Description: This program interacts with students following their grading results, offering encouragement, advice, and support akin to a chatbot. It encourages students to reflect on their performance, shares study tips, and motivates to enhance their academic journey.
